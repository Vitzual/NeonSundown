# Note about this repository
This repository contains external assets from the Unity asset store that I am not able to share. Though the game is almost completely comprised of my own work, there are a few assets you'll need to grab if you wish to be able to fully run the game in the unity editor.

**Paid Assets:**
- [**Modern UI Pack |** $30 (Required)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-150824)
- [**Odin Inspector |** $55 (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041)
- [**MK Glow Lite |** $10 (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/mk-glow-lite-155643)

**Free Assets:**
- [**LeanTween |** FREE (Required)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595)
- [**Audio Visualize Anything |** FREE (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/audio-visualize-anything-190384)

**Note:** The game can function without any of the above assets, but it will require a bit of modification!

# Note about this repository
This repository contains external assets from the Unity asset store that I am not able to share. Though the game is almost completely comprised of my own work, there are a few assets you'll need to grab if you wish to be able to fully run it in the unity editor. (though I recommend treating this repository as something you can reference for your own projects, rather than contribute to)

**Paid Assets:**
- [**Modern UI Pack |** $30 (Required)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-150824)
- [**Odin Inspector |** $55 (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041)
- [**MK Glow Lite |** $10 (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/mk-glow-lite-155643)

**Free Assets:**
- [**LeanTween |** FREE (Required)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595)
- [**Audio Visualize Anything |** FREE (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/audio-visualize-anything-190384)

**Note:** The game can function without any of the above assets, but it will require a bit of modification!

# Setup instructions
In order to run the game, you'll need the latest LTS version of Unity. You can find this by installing [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and than going to installs and adding the latest LTS version. Once installed, follow the below steps to get setup...

1. Pull the project files onto your machine (I recommend GitHub desktop)
2. Open the project. Most likely it will prompt you to enter safemode since it'll be missing references to the above assets. Just click "Ignore" for the time being.
3. Once inside, grab the above assets from the Unity asset store and place them in the External folder. (except for Odin Inspector, place that in the Plugins folder) Note that if you don't want to obtain the above assets, you'll have to work your way through the errors and remove any references to them.

And that's it, you're good to go! Again if you decide not to get the above assets it will require some slight modification to get running, but it is still entirely possible to run the game without them.

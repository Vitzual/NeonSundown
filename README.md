# Note about this repository
This repository contains external assets from the Unity asset store, as well as licensed sounds and music that I am not able to share. I recommend treating this repository as something you can reference for your own projects, though if you wish to get the game running in the Unity editor it is still possible (with or without them)

# External Assets
Below is a list of all the assets used in the project, along with whether or not they're required for the game to run properly in the editor. Though the game is comprised almost completely of my own work, I do use these assets to save development time as well as for QOL purposes. 

**Paid Assets:**
- [**Modern UI Pack |** $30 (Recommended)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/modern-ui-pack-150824) - Used for a few in-game UI prefabs
- [**Odin Inspector |** $55 (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041) - Used to beautify Unity's interface
- [**MK Glow Lite |** $10 (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/mk-glow-lite-155643) - Used to make objects glow

**Free Assets:**
- [**LeanTween |** FREE (Required)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/leantween-3595) - Used to optimize moving UI objects
- [**Audio Visualize Anything |** FREE (Optional)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/audio-visualize-anything-190384) - Used for Neon Sundown title on menu

# External Audio
If you've pulled the project files and obtained the above assets (or modified the game to work without them), you'll need to obtain the audio files used in the game. All sound effects were obtained from ZapSplat, and the music is provided by Volt Mother. Links to both below.
